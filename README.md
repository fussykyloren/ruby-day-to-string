## Information
These functions take either a wday value or cwday and returns a string of the day of the week, i.e. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, etc. This is not easily accessible in Ruby (to my knowledge) so I made a function for me and am happy to share it with you now!
This function is built with Ruby v2.6.3p62. To check your version, run:
```
ruby -v
```
## Status
At this time, the project is __*finished*__.
## Instructions
1. If you do not have ruby installed, follow these [instructions](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).
2. Clone this repository using the following link: https://github.com/fussykyloren/ruby-day-to-string.git
3. Use the function as you wish! If you have any suggestions, don't hesitate to raise an issue!
